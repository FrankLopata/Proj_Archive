Class Coins contains 4 counters to track how many of each coin denomination it contains, 

because Coins cannot remove more than it holds of any denomination, so coins can be removed 

from the holder only if there is enough of each denomination to make

exact change. For example, Coins cannot convert a quarter into 2 dimes
and 1 nickel.

word_count reads words from a file named sample_doc.txt - one at a time - and counts
the frequency of each word, but ignores all stop words in a file named stopwords.txt. It 
then prints to the output file named frequency.txt  the words with their corresponding 
frequencies in ascending alphabetical order by word.
