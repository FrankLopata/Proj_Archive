This branch is used to store all files that were in my coding folder. This folder was from 2021 and before, and is 
a mix of school projects and personal projects all mashed together. Each file is an individual program, so feel free
to play with each one.


# This repository contains all the coding projects
# I could find from before March 2023.
#
# Each README file will contain a short description
# of what each program does. Be aware that some 
# programs do not come with any user input options
