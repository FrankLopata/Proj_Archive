MapArray does the functions of std::map, however it does not use sort() in order to sort itself.
Instead, it is sorted upon insertion. The elements of MapArray must be pair<Key,Value>, where Key and Value are typename template parameters.
An iterator inside class MapArray allows random access iteration through it.
