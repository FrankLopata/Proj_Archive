Computes course grades given a gradebook defined in an input file named gradebook.txt. The program produces an output file, named course_grades.txt, with a list of students followed by their course grade summaries of each component average (with components Homework, Quiz, and Final), and the final course grade (numerical and letter) computed as a weighted sum of component averages (after dropping one lowest quiz score).
