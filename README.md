Proccess numbers :
- reads a sequence of integers from a file named rand_numbers.txt
- stores them in a std::vector,
- sorts them in ascending order (some numbers may appear more than once; keep the duplicates in the results),
- writes the odd ones to a file named odds.txt, following the format in the sample output below with a newline after the list of numbers, and
- writes the even ones to a file named evens.txt, following the format in the sample output below. (Yes, the evens and odds have different output formats.)
